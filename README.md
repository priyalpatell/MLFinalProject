# MLFinalProject
## Our Goal
We wanted to predict the when the next UFO sighting will be in California and where in California it will take place using latitude and longitude values.

## The Dataset
"scrubbed.csv" was a ufo sightings dataset found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings)

## View Our Code
Importing Keras tends to crash Jupyter Notebook, so please only view/run our code from this google colab link which seemed to fix this problem

Note: you will be instructed to log into you google drive account associated with your ucdavis email & select ALL for access
## Running Our UI
$ streamlit run project_code_ui.py

Note: takes a bit of time to load results

Example:

  Input of year = 1
  
    question 1 ~8 minutes
    
    question 2 ~9 minutes
    
  Input of year = 2
  
    question 1 ~16 minutes
    
    question 2 ~9 minutes
